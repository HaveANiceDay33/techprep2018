<p class ="intro">My best packages include full day coverage of both video and photography to capture the most important moments of your day. I pride myself on giving my clients the service they deserve and on making their experience a memorable one. The high resolution processed digital negatives that you receive are not just "proof" quality!<br /><br />

The total number of photographs often goes into the thousands so you can remember all of your special day. All the Images are optimized for balance, contrast, and rich saturation. Some special photos are edited to black and white, composite, color overlay on black and white, and many other elegant effects. I will never hold your negatives hostage! In other words, I don't force you to order prints only from me at inflated prices; you can print on your own home printer or at any developer you wish. I do recommend using a quality photo finishing shop for the best results.<br /><br />

You’ll also get a DVD containing all your photographs in unedited form. This allows you go back years later and edit yourself or have someone else change your photographs to your specifications and size. DVDs are delivered with a customized label and case. <br /><br />

The Video work is compiled using no loss professional grade software with Dolby® Digital AC-3 encoding for the best sound possible.  All customers will receive their wedding day edited for aesthetics and in its entirety.  I won't spend an entire day at your wedding and then give you a highlights video like other companies. </p>
